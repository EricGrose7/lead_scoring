# Lead Scoring
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to build a lead scoring model using machine learning techniques. The lead scoring model is used to predict the likelihood of a lead converting into a customer based on various attributes such as demographics, past behavior, and engagement.

**Dataset**   <br>
The dataset used in this project is a hypothetical dataset containing information about leads in a sales pipeline. The dataset contains information such as lead demographics, lead source, lead behavior, and engagement metrics. The dataset is split into a training set and a test set, with the training set used to train the machine learning model and the test set used to evaluate the performance of the model.

**Machine Learning Model**    <br>
The machine learning model used in this project is a binary classification model that predicts whether a lead is likely to convert into a customer or not. The model is trained on the training set using several classification algorithms, including logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and XGBoost. The performance of the model is evaluated on the test set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Jupyter Notebook**    <br>
The Jupyter Notebook in this project walks through the process of building a lead scoring model using Python and machine learning techniques. The notebook includes several sections, including:

- Data exploration and cleaning, where the dataset is loaded and explored to identify missing values, outliers, and other data quality issues
- Feature engineering, where new features are created from the existing dataset to improve the predictive power of the model
- Model training, where the machine learning model is trained using the training set and evaluated using the test set
- Model interpretation, where the feature importances of the model are analyzed to identify the most important factors contributing to lead conversion
- Model deployment, where the trained model is saved and can be used to score new leads in real-time

The Jupyter Notebook includes code snippets and visualizations to help users understand the data, the model, and the results.

**Conclusion**   <br>
This Jupyter Notebook provides a comprehensive guide for building a lead scoring model using machine learning techniques. The notebook walks through the process of data exploration and cleaning, feature engineering, model training, model interpretation, and model deployment. The notebook includes several machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and XGBoost, and includes visualizations and code snippets to help users understand the data and the model. By following this notebook, users can build a lead scoring model to predict the likelihood of a lead converting into a customer, helping businesses prioritize their sales efforts and improve their conversion rates.
